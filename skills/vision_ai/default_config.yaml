  de: Lass deinen Wingman alles analysieren, was auf deinem Bildschirm zu sehen ist.
examples:
  - en: What is on my screen?
    de: Was siehst du auf meinem Bildschirm?
prompt: |
  You can see what the user is seeing, you can analyse it, and you can answer all questions about what you see.
  Use the tool 'analyse_what_you_or_user_sees' if you are asked to analyse what you see, or analyze what the user sees.
  You can also see the screen of the user. Call 'analyse_what_you_or_user_sees' for this too.
  If the user wants to specifically send or upload an image for analysis, make them open the image on their computer and inform you when they have done this. When the image is opened, make a snapshot and analyze it.
  If the user wants you to analyze what they are looking at, treat this as if the image is already open on their screen.
