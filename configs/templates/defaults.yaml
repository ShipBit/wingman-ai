# This config/YAML file is very sensitive to indentation!
# Make sure you use a single "TAB" character for indentation. Do NOT use the spacebar to indent.
# More docs and useful tools to edit this here:

# ==================================== GLOBAL CONFIGURATION ====================================
# This is the default config for all wingmen.
# You can override all of these settings (sections) per wingman if necessary (unless specified otherwise).
# To do so, simply copy and paste the config section(s) below and indent/nest them under your wingman config.
# Always keep the structure intact!
#
# ──────────────────────────────── FEATURES ─────────────────────────────────
features:
  # If enabled, the Wingman will skip executing any keypresses.
  # It will also print more debug messages and benchmark results.
  debug_mode: false

  # ─────────────────────── TTS Provider ─────────────────────────
  # You can override the text-to-spech provider if your Wingman supports it. Our OpenAI wingman does!
  # Note that the other providers may have additional config blocks as shown below for edge_tts. These are only used if the provider is set here.
  tts_provider: azure # available: openai, edge_tts, elevenlabs, azure, xvasynth

  # ─────────────────────── Speech to text Provider ─────────────────────────
  # You can override the speech to text provider to use a different one than the default.
  # Note that the other providers may have additional config blocks as shown below for edge_tts. These are only used if the provider is set here.
  stt_provider: azure_speech # available: openai, azure, azure_speech

  # ─────────────────────── Conversation Provider ─────────────────────────
  # You can override the conversation provider to use a different one than the default.
  # Note that the other providers may have additional config blocks as shown below for edge_tts. These are only used if the provider is set here.
  conversation_provider: azure # available: openai, azure

  # ─────────────────────── Summarize Provider ─────────────────────────
  # You can override the summarize provider to use a different one than the default.
  # Note that the other providers may have additional config blocks as shown below for edge_tts. These are only used if the provider is set here.
  summarize_provider: azure # available: openai, azure

  # ─────────────────────── Cost Control ─────────────────────────
  # How many messages should a Wingman remember in your conversations?
  # "0" means you start fresh with just the context after every message. This is like restarting Wingman after every interaction.
  # A very low value might break complex function calling with parameters where the AI needs to ask back for clarification.
  #
  # Use this to limit the number of tokens used in your conversations and to reduce the cost of using the OpenAI API.
  # Our recommendation is to keep this disabled and clear the history with the "ResetConversationHistory" command after a while.
  #
  # uncomment this (=remove the "# in front) to enable!
  #remember_messages: 3

# ────────────────────────────── SOUND SETTINGS ───────────────────────────────
# If you want to use sound effects with 11Labs, you need to enable them in the elevenlabs config below.
sound:
  # You can put as many sound effects here as you want. They stack and are added in the defined order here.
  # Available: RADIO, ROBOT, INTERIOR_HELMET, INTERIOR_SMALL, INTERIOR_MEDIUM, INTERIOR_LARGE
  effects: []

  # adds a beep/Quindar sound before and after the wingman talks
  play_beep: false

# ────────────────────────────────── OPEN AI ────────────────────────────────────
openai:
  # The model to use for conversations aka "chit-chat" and for function calls.
  # gpt-4 is more powerful than gpt-3.5 but also 10x more expensive.
  # gpt-3.5 is the default and should be enough for most use cases.
  # If something is not working as expected, you might want to test it with gpt-4.
  conversation_model: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 # available: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106, gpt-4-1106-preview (and more)

  # This model summarizes function responses, like API call responses etc.
  # In most cases gpt-3.5 should be enough.
  summarize_model: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 # available: gpt-3.5-turbo-1106, gpt-4-1106-preview (and more)

  # The voice to use for OpenAI text-to-speech.
  # Only used if features > tts_provider is set to 'openai' above.
  tts_voice: nova # available: nova, alloy, echo, fable, onyx, shimmer

  # ADVANCED:
  # If you want to use a different API endpoint, uncomment this and configure it here.
  # Use this to hook up your local in-place OpenAI replacement like Ollama or if you want to use a proxy.
  #base_url: https://api.openai.com # or the localhost address of your local LLM etc.
  #organization: whatever # If you have an organization key, you can set it here.

# ────────────────────────────────── EDGE TTS ────────────────────────────────────

# ────────────────────────────────── ELEVENLABS ────────────────────────────────────
# https://elevenlabs.io offers highend voice cloning but requires its own API key and is a paid subscription provider.
# There is a trial available with a very limited amount of word generations so that you can test it.
# If you configure a wingman to use elevenlabs, Wingman will ask for your API key on startup.
# Only used if tts_provider in features is set to 'elevenlabs' above.
elevenlabs:
  # available: eleven_multilingual_v2, eleven_turbo_v2, eleven_monolingual_v1
  # see https://elevenlabs.io/docs/speech-synthesis/models
  model: eleven_multilingual_v2
  latency: 2 # optimization, 0 - 4. Higher values are faster but can produce audio stuttering.

  voice:
    # You can configure "Premade voices" from the dropdown on https://elevenlabs.io/speech-synthesis by name.
    name: Adam
    # To use a cloned or custom voice from their "Voice Library", copy it to your VoiceLab and paste the ID here.
    # Only you(r) API key has acces to these voice IDs, so you can't share them.
    #id: xxx  # id overrules name if both are set!

  voice_settings:
    stability: 0.71 # 0.0 - 1.0
    similarity_boost: 0.5 # 0.0 - 1.0

# ────────────────────────────────── XVASYNTH ────────────────────────────────────
# XVASynth is a free program on Steam that uses your local computer resources to generate text to speech using free voice models created by the community.
# You can find the program here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1765720/xVASynth/
# The ideal setup is to start XVASynth and then run WingmanAI. However, if you do not do so, WingmanAI will try to run XVASynth if you use it for a wingman.
# This implementation only supports XVASynth v3 voices.
# You can find the voice folders you have installed in the [your xVASynth directory]/resources/app/models folder, and inside of each will be the voices.
# An example below is where "terminator" is the name of the game folder inside of "models" and "tn-850" is the name of the voice.
# The name of the voice is the name without the .pt or .json file extensions.
# Only used if features > tts_provider is set to 'xvasynth' above.
xvasynth:
  xvasynth_path: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\xVASynth # The path to your install of XVASynth.  If you do not provide this and try to use xvasynth there will be an error.
  process_device: cpu # Can be cpu or gpu, if gpu you may need to take more steps to have xvasynth run on gpu.  Defaults to cpu.
  game_folder_name: terminator # The game folder name of the voice you donwloaded to use as your primary xvasynth voice.  This can be overwritten in a particular wingman.  If you do not provide this and try to use xvasynth there will be an error.
  voice: tn-T850 # The name of the voice you downloaded to use.  This can be overwritten in a particular wingman.  If you do not provide this and try to use xvasynth there will be an error.
  language: en # The language the voice will speak in. Some XVASynth voices are trained to be multi-lingual.  Defaults to english, 'en'.
  pace: 1.0 # The speed of the voice playback. Defaults to 1.0.
  use_sr: false # Whether to use XVASynth's super resolution mode.  Will take longer and generally not recommended.  Defaults to false.
  use_cleanup: false # Whether to use XVASynth's cleanup mode.  May make voice quality better or worse depending on the voice model.  Defaults to false.
  synthesize_url: http://127.0.0.1:8008/synthesize # This should typically be left alone, changing it will cause errors unless you manually changed xvasynth's server
  load_model_url: http://127.0.0.1:8008/loadModel # This should be typically left alone, changing it will cause errors unless you manually changed xvasynth's server
# ────────────────────────────── GLOBAL COMMANDS ───────────────────────────────
# You can use these in all wingmen and you can put your own here, too.
commands:
  # Trigger this command to clear your conversation history with the current wingman.
  # This is like setting "remember_messages" to 0 above, but "on-demand". You'll restart with just the context.
  - name: ResetConversationHistory # don't rename this!
    instant_activation:
      - Forget everything!
      - Clear conversation history!
    responses:
      - Conversation history cleared.
