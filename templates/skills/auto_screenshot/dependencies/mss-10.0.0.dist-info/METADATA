```python
from mss import mss

# The simplest use, save a screenshot of the 1st monitor
with mss() as sct:
    sct.shot()
```

An ultra-fast cross-platform multiple screenshots module in pure python using ctypes.

- **Python 3.9+**, PEP8 compliant, no dependency, thread-safe;
- very basic, it will grab one screenshot by monitor or a screenshot of all monitors and save it to a PNG file;
- but you can use PIL and benefit from all its formats (or add yours directly);
- integrate well with Numpy and OpenCV;
- it could be easily embedded into games and other software which require fast and platform optimized methods to grab screenshots (like AI, Computer Vision);
- get the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/BoboTiG/python-mss);
- learn with a [bunch of examples](https://python-mss.readthedocs.io/examples.html);
- you can [report a bug](https://github.com/BoboTiG/python-mss/issues);
- need some help? Use the tag *python-mss* on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python-mss);
- and there is a [complete, and beautiful, documentation](https://python-mss.readthedocs.io) :)
- **MSS** stands for Multiple ScreenShots;
